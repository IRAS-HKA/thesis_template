If you haven't worked with LaTeX before we recommend using the online Editor `Overleaf`. To do this you have to follow these steps:

2. Create an Account on https://www.overleaf.com/
3. Click the *New Project* Button
4. Choose *Upload Project* 
5. Select the `.zip` archive you downloaded previously
6. Open `my_document_info.tex`inside Overleaf and enter your information in the respective fields in the editor on the left half of your screen.
7. Open `main.tex` inside Overleaf and set your language, type of work document and color (faculty) in the second line. 
8. Read Chapter 1 on how to use this template and have a look at [this](https://de.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) basic tutorial 


## How to collaborate
If you are using `Overleaf` you can invite other people to your current project where they can change and adjust your text. This might be useful for proofreaders or your supervisor. 
If you have decided to work offline on your personal device, e.g. using MikTeX, we recommend to create your project as a private Github repository, which you can then be shared with others.
